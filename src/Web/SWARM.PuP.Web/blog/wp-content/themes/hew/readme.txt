Hew offers four widget areas, located in a slide-out top panel. To show and hide the panel, click the three dots icon in the header’s top right corner. If no widgets are active, the icon won’t appear. Widgets can be configured via Appearance > Widgets.

= How to set up Custom Menu? =

Hew comes with one Custom Menu in the header, which can be configured via Appearance > Menus. This menu is hidden by default, and will not be displayed unless a Custom Menu is assigned.

= How to add the social links? =

With Hew, you have the option to display links to your social media profiles in the footer, just above the website credits. Icons for Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn and most other popular networks are included, and Hew will automatically display an icon for each service if it's available.

- Set up the menu -

To automatically apply icons to your links, simply create a new Custom Menu from Appearance > Menus. You can name it however you like. Next, add each of your social links to this menu. Each menu item should be added as a custom link.

Once your menu is created and your social links are added, assign it to the Social Menu location under Menu Settings.
